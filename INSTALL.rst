Installation
============

This software depends on:

- numpy
- scipy
- sympy
- matplotlib
- nibabel

It is being developed (and hence best tested) with Python 3.6.
While not explicitly tested for, other recent versions of Python 3 are very
likely to be working correctly.

Python 2 is no longer supported and although many parts of the library still
work without issues, there are some features known not to work with Python 2.

If you experience any issues, please consider reporting it.


Note
----

Support to Python 2 has been discontinued.
