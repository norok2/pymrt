Overview
--------
This software provides a support Python library and auxiliary console-based
tools to perform common tasks for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
The aim is to be the multi-tool of MRI.

At present, the following features are best supported:

- generic tools for image analysis from an MRI perspective
- data analysis for quantitative MRI experiments

On top of this, additional effort is currently being put in the following
areas:

- image reconstruction and related features (e.g. coil combination, etc.)

It is relatively easy to extend and users are encouraged to tweak with it.

As a result of the code maturity, some of the library components may undergo
(eventually heavy) refactoring, although this is currently unexpected.


Releases information are available through ``NEWS.rst``.

For a more comprehensive list of changes see ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
