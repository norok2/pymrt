pymrt: Python MRI Tools for quantitative MRI data analysis
==========================================================

Overview
--------
This software provides a support Python library and auxiliary console based
tools to perform common tasks for the analysis of quantitative MRI data.

It is relatively easy to extend and users are encouraged to tweak with it.

As a result of the code maturity, some of the library components may undergo
(eventually heavy) refactoring, although this is currently unexpected.


Releases information are available through ``NEWS.rst``.

For a more comprehensive list of changes see ``CHANGELOG.rst``.
